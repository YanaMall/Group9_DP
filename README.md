This mobile app motivates users to walk daily. Each user can have one or multiple pets and they need to take their digital pet for a walk. The app needs to track the step of the user when it is activated. Then, the mood/health of the pet may depend on how much they get to exercise, and taking different routes may also be encouraged. The previous walks should be accessible and the stats such as how many steps, distance, duration, and date should be saved. Multiple users can schedule a meeting to walk their pets.
